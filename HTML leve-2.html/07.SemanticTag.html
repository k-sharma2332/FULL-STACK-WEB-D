</head>

<!--
    Semantic Tags : Semantic HTML tags are HTML elements that clearly describe their meaning.
    They define the content they contain, enhancing the accessibility and user experience of web content.
    We can clearly judge thei content just by the name of the tag.
    For ex : form, table, header, footer, main, section etc.


    Importance Of Sementic Markup :-

a) Accessibility : Semantic HTML improves accessibility as it provides a clear structure and meaning to the content,
   making it easier for assistive technologies like screen readers to interpret the content.

b) SEO : Search engines use semantic elements to better understand the content and context of a web page. 
   This increases the chances that your content will be selected as a candidate for ranking on the 
   search engine results page (SERP) for relevant keywords.

c) Readability : Semantic HTML tags make the code easier to read and understand, 
   which is beneficial for web developers reviewing the code.

d) Responsiveness : Semantic HTML improves responsiveness because the browser can interpret the code better.

e) Future-Proofing : Semantic HTML is more future-proof as it adheres to the latest standards of web development.
    
f) Interoperability : When developers write semantically, they use standardized names for elements that browsers
   can identify, which helps make HTML more interoperable across the internet.

g) Better User Experience : Pages made with semantic elements are much easier to read, offering better user experience.

h) Efficiency : Semantic HTML requires less memory than non-semantic HTML, which can play a role for larger websites.
